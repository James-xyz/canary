        having barometric pressure measurement was a bonus, but I have since
        discovered that it can effect health (according to the internet:
        https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/5-effects-barometric-pressure-has-humans-you-really-can-pedram-shojai/)
        so we might take a stab in the dark and ascribe some safety values to
        the pressure as well. To be really effective this should look at rates
        of change I suppose, but here we can probably just do a delta to average
        pressure?
    
        1,013.25 hPa is one atm (mean pressure at sea level:
            https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_pressure)

        1084.8 hPa is highest (adjusted-to-sea level barometric pressure)
        recorded, and
        The lowest non-tornadic atmospheric pressure ever measured was 870 hPa

        again with the wet finger in the air, below values may need to be
        adjusted, but the main point is that the value cahnges the display and
        warrants notice by user..
